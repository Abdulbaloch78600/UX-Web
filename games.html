                <h2>Mario's Tennis</h2>
                <p>Mario's Tennis is a sports game developed by Nintendo and released for the Virtual Boy in 1995. </p>
                <p> The game uses a control system that differs from most other video tennis games on the market.</p>
                <p> Shots are performed by pressing one, or both, of the two main buttons (A or B), which make</p>
                <p> the ball spin in different ways. Pressing a button twice strikes the tennis shot with more</p>
                <p> power and spin. Additionally, pressing the two buttons in a different order can result in</p>
                <p> a different type of shot altogether, such as a lob or drop shot. Both buttons can be</p>
                <p>pressed at the same time to hit a very powerful smash shot. The longer a button</p>
                <p>is pressed before contact is made with the ball, the stronger the shot will be.</p>
                <p>The control system allows players of all levels to become familiar with the mechanics</p>
                <p>of the game within a very short time, whilst also encouraging advanced players to</p>
                <p> take advantage of the variety of shots offered to come up with different strategies</p>
                <p> for winning points. A total of seven types of shot are possible using only the two</p>
                <p>main buttons of the controller. These gameplay mechanics were later brought to the</p>
                <p>newer games of the Mario Tennis series.</p>

                <h2>Red Alarm</h2>
                <p>
                    Red Alarm is an action-packed video game developed by Nintendo and released for the<br>
                    Virtual Boy console in 1995. It is a 3D shooter game, developed and published by Nintendo,<br>
                    and was among the few games released for the ill-fated Virtual Boy. <br>
                    The game is set in a distant future, where an alien race has taken control of all<br>
                    the planets in the universe. The player takes control of a battle tank, the <br>
                    T-13 Armoured Strike vehicle, and must battle their way through the planetâ€™s<br>
                    surface, in an effort to liberate the planet from the alien forces.<br>
                    The gameplay of Red Alarm is quite unique. The game is played in a 3D environment,<br>
                    and the player must maneuver their tank around the surface of the planet,<br>
                    while battling enemy tanks, turrets, and other obstacles. The tank is equipped<br>
                    with two guns, a laser cannon and a machine gun, which can be used to take down<br>
                    enemy tanks and turrets. The game also features a shield, which can be used to<br>
                    protect the tank from enemy fire. The game features multiple levels, and <br>
                    each level introduces new enemies, obstacles, and objectives to complete.<br>
                    The graphics of Red Alarm are quite impressive, given the age of the Virtual Boy<br>
                    console. The game is presented in a 3D environment, with detailed backgrounds<br>
                    and environments. The tanks, turrets, and other objects are all well-rendered,<br>
                    and the game has a nice frame rate, despite the hardware limitations of the <br>
                    Virtual Boy.</p>
